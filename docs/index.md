# Index

Mainly you could copy the README.md here. However, you should be careful with:

- The banner section is different
- Link to assets (handling dark mode is different between GitHub and the documentation)
- Relative links

## 🔥 Tutorials

We propose some tutorials to get familiar with the library and its api:

- [Getting started](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XproaVxXjO9nrBSyyy7BuKJ1vy21iHs2) <sub> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deel-ai/<libname>/blob/master/docs/notebooks/demo_fake.ipynb) </sub>

You do not necessarily need to register the notebooks on the GitHub. Notebooks can be hosted on a specific [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DOI1CsL-m9jGjkWM1hyDZ1vKmSU1t-be).

## 🚀 Quick Start

Libname requires some stuff and several libraries including Numpy. Installation can be done using Pypi:

```python
pip install libname
```

Now that Libname is installed, here are some basic examples of what you can do with the available modules.

### Print Hello World

Let's start with a simple example:

```python
from libname.fake import hello_world

hello_world()
```

### Make addition

In order to add `a` to `b` you can use:

```python
from libname.fake import addition

a = 1
b = 2
c = addition(a, b)
```

## 📦 What's Included
