# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

From opening a bug report to creating a pull request: every contribution is
appreciated and welcome. If you're planning to implement a new feature or change
the api please create an [issue first](https://github.com/deel-ai/oodeel/issues/new). This way we can ensure that your precious
work is not in vain.


## Setup with make

- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/deel-ai/oodeel.git`.
- Go to your freshly downloaded repo `cd oodeel`
- Create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies for development:

  `make prepare-dev && source oodeel_dev_env/bin/activate`.

Welcome to the team !


## Tests

To run test `make test`
This command activate your virtual environment and launch the `tox` command.


`tox` on the otherhand will do the following:
- run pytest on the tests folder with python 3.7, python 3.8, python 3.9 and python 3.10
> Note: If you do not have those 3 interpreters the tests would be only performs with your current interpreter
- run flake8 on the oodeel main files, with python 3.9 and python 3.10.
> Note: It is possible that pylint throw false-positive errors. If the linting test failed please check first pylint output to point out the reasons.

Please, make sure you run all the tests at least once before opening a pull request.

A word toward flake8 for those that don't know it:
> Flake8 is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions.

Basically, it will check that your code follow a certain number of convention. Any Pull Request will go through a Github workflow ensuring that your code respect the Pylint conventions (most of them at least).

## Submitting Changes

After getting some feedback, push to your fork and submit a pull request. We
may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives, but for small changes
your pull request should be accepted quickly (see [Governance policy](https://github.com/deel-ai/oodeel/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md)).

Something that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

- Write tests and ensure that the existing ones pass.
- If `make test` is succesful, you have fair chances to pass the CI workflows (linting and test)
- Follow the existing coding style and run `make check_all` to check all files format.
- Write a [good commit message](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) (we follow a lowercase convention, see below).
- For a major fix/feature make sure your PR has an issue and if it doesn't, please create one. This would help discussion with the community, and polishing ideas in case of a new feature.

# pre-commit : Conventional Commits 1.0.0

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]

```

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

- fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).

- feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).

- BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.

- types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the the Angular convention) recommends *build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:*, and [others](https://delicious-insights.com/fr/articles/git-hooks-et-commitlint/).

- footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.

- Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). A scope may be provided to a commitâ€™s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays.
